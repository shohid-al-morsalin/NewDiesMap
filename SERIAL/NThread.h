	\brief definition of CAG_Thread class
	\author AMER GERZIC

	To use derive a new class from CAG_Thread class and
	override the virtual ThreadMain() function like following:			\n
																		\n
	while(!ShouldDie())	\n
	{																	\n
		... let the worker work											\n
	}																	\n
																		\n
	History:
	- ***** Version 1.0.0.0 *****
	- Date: 08.17.2001	Author: Amer Gerzic
	- Class created and tested on windows NT
	- ***** Version 1.0.0.1 *****
	- Date: 08.19.2001	Author: Amer Gerzic
	- GetThreadStatus() function added. Reports is the thread running.
	- ***** Version 1.0.0.2 *****
	- Date: 07.08.2002	Author: Amer Gerzic
	- Fixed bug in the StartThread function with GetThreadStatus check for thread activity
	- The thread status checking was changed from WaitForSingleObject to GetExitCodeThread
	- Also ThreadMain function made private
	- ***** Version 1.0.0.3 *****
	- Date: 04.11.2003	Author: Amer Gerzic
	- Added function "shouldDie()" for easier thread abortion
